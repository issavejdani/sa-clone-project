## Introduction
 
Adding new projects to the team space is one of the primary activities that you do as a team administrator. Sometimes this activity requires a lot of steps or can be error-prone and time-consuming. That is where the new clone project feature comes in handy. This new feature allows you to duplicate a project in fewer steps, saving you time and effort.
 
You can create similar projects to existing ones without configuring them from scratch. Once done, you can change the settings of the new one. 
 
This document covers a step by step guide on how to clone a project.
 
## Clone an existing project

To clone a project you need to take the following steps:

1. Go to **Projects**.
2. Select the three dots button next to the project.
3. Click and choose Clone.

## Things to consider


### Project name
As you can see in the second screenshot there is a default name for the project which can also be customized by you. 

- The format of the default name is **\<Original project name\> (1)**. 

- If there is already a project with the name **\<Original project
name\> (1)**, the cloned project name will be **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)**. 

- If **\<Original project name\> (1)** is cloned while **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)** already exists, the name of the newly created project will be **\<Original project name\> (1) (2)** and so on.

### Properties

As you can see in the third screenshot, some of the properties are dependent on each other. For example if you uncheck **Classes** the **Workflow** checkbox is unchecked automatically.
