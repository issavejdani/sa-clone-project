# Cloning a project
 
## Introduction
 
Adding new projects to the team space is one of primary activities that you do as a team administrator. Sometimes this activity requires a lot of steps or can be error-prone and time-consuming. That is where the new clone project feature comes in handy. This new feature allows you to duplicate a project in fewer steps, saving you time and effort.
 
You can create similar projects to existing ones without configuring them from scratch. Once done, you can change the settings of the new one. 
 
This document covers a step by step guide on how to clone a project.
