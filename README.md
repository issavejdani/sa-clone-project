## Introduction
 
Adding new projects to the team space is one of your primary activities as a Team Admin. This activity requires several steps and can be time-consuming. That is where the new **clone** project feature comes in handy. This new feature allows you to duplicate a project in fewer steps, saving you time and effort.
 
You can create projects similar to the existing ones without having to configure them from scratch. Once you've finished cloning them, you can modify their settings.
 
This document contains a step-by-step guide for cloning a project.

3. Select **Clone** from the list.
4. Provide a new unique name in the popup window.

> ### Who can clone projects?
>Only Team Admins can clone projects.

> When you clone a project, no items are copied or moved to the new project. Properties (based on what you've selected) are the only items that are copied to the new project.

> ### Project name
>The new project has an editable default name.
>- The default name format is **\<Original project name\> (1)**. 
> - If **\<Original project
name\> (1)** already exists, the new project name changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)**. 
> - If **\<Original project name\> (1)** is cloned while **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)** already exists, the name of the newly created project changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (2)** and so on.

> ### Properties
> By default, all of the properties are checked. Some properties are interdependent. If you clear **Classes** checkbox, for example, the **Workflow** checkbox is automatically unchecked and is not copied to the new project.
