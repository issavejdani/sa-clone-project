## Introduction
 
Adding new projects to the team space is one of your primary activities as a team administrator. This activity requires several steps or can be error-prone and time-consuming. That is where the new clone project feature comes in handy. This new feature allows you to duplicate a project in fewer steps, saving you time and effort.
 
You can create projects similar to the existing ones without having to configure them from scratch. Once you finish cloning them, you can modify their settings.
 
This document contains a step-by-step guide for cloning a project.

## Clone an existing project

To clone a project, perform the following steps:

1. Go to **Projects**.
2. Select the three dots button next to the project.
3. Click and select **Clone**.

4. Provide a new unique name.
5. Select the properties that must be cloned.

Once you've finished cloning, you see a notification at the bottom left corner of the page. This notification indicates that the project cloning was successful.

## Things to consider

### Project name
The new project, as seen in the second screenshot, has an editable default name.

- The format of the default name is **\<Original project name\> (1)**. 

- If **\<Original project
name\> (1)** already exists, the new project name changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)**. 

- If **\<Original project name\> (1)** is cloned while **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)** already exists, the name of the newly created project changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (2)** and so on.

### Properties

By default, all of the properties are checked. However, as shown in the third screenshot, some of the properties are interdependent. If you deselect Classes, for example, the Workflow checkbox is automatically unchecked and is not copied to the new project.
