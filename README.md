## Introduction
 
Adding new projects to the team space is one of your primary activities as a team administrator. This activity requires several steps or can be error-prone and time-consuming. That is where the new **clone** project feature comes in handy. This new feature allows you to duplicate a project in fewer steps, saving you time and effort.
 
You can create projects similar to the existing ones without having to configure them from scratch. Once you finish cloning them, you can modify their settings.
 
This document contains a step-by-step guide for cloning a project.

## Clone project

To clone a project, perform the following steps:

1. Go to **Projects**.
2. Select the three dots button next to your desired project.
3. Select **Clone** from the list.
4. Provide a new unique name in the popup window.
5. Select properties that must be cloned.
6. Click **Clone**.

Once you've finished cloning, you will see a notification at the bottom left corner of the page. This notification indicates that the project cloning was successful.


> ### Who can clone projects?
>Only Team Admins can clone projects.

> ### Project name
>The new project has an editable default name.
>- The default name format is **\<Original project name\> (1)**. 
> - If **\<Original project
name\> (1)** already exists, the new project name changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)**. 
> - If **\<Original project name\> (1)** is cloned while **\<Original project name\> (1) (1)** already exists, the name of the newly created project changes to **\<Original project name\> (1) (2)** and so on.

> ### Properties
> By default, all of the properties are checked. However. Some properties are interdependent. If you clear **Classes** checkbox, for example, the **Workflow** checkbox is automatically unchecked and is not copied to the new project.
